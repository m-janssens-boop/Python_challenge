# Python_challenge
Description: There are two separate projects contained in this repository, PyBank and PyPoll. 

PyBank: this script sorts through the CSV file of budget data located in the 'Resources' folder of the PyBank folder. It then compiles the data that it has cleaned (max, min, overall totals, etc) and prints it into both the terminal window and a separate txt file that is generated in the 'analysis' folder of PyBank. See comments in script for the details of how this is accomplished.

PyPoll: this script sorts through the CSV file of voting data located in the 'Resources' folder of the PyPoll folder. It then compiles the data that it has cleaned (candidate names, total votes, percentages, and winner) and prints it into both the terminal window and a separate txt file that is generated in the 'analysis' folder of PyPoll. See comments in script for the details of how this is accomplished.
